# TQS - Project

In the scope of "Teste e Qualidade de Software" course, the main objective of this project was to develop a medium-sized project, where we could apply the knowledge acquired in the course, regarding software quality assurance and software enterprise architecture patterns. In order to make the several projects comparable across the different groups, all the projects were expected to follow the same guidelines.

## [PickAPoint](http://34.175.190.59:5173/) (DPP)

PickAPoint consists of a network of Pickup Points that a customer can choose when placing an order. These Pickup Points are physical locations, such as stores or even gas stations, where the customer can pick up their order at a time that is convenient for them. This service benefits both customers and businesses. Additionally, the service also provides an API that can be integrated with e-commerce websites, allowing its customers to choose a Pickup Point when placing an order, and track their status progress.

> If you want to test the service, you can use the following credentials: email: `worten@gmail.com`, password: `worten`.

> Note: If you register a package with your phone number, you will not receive any SMS, since the free trial of Twilio only allows us to send SMS to the owner of the Twilio account.

## [PrintPlate](http://34.175.190.59:9000/) (E-store)

PrintPlate is an e-commerce website where customers can buy art plates. The web application allows customers to choose an existing pickup point available in the PickAPoint network as the delivery method for their order. The website also allows customers to track their orders, and cancel them if they wish to do so.
